### `Unitary Matrix` is for complex numbers how is it called for real numbers?

A unitary matrix is indeed a concept primarily associated with complex numbers. In the context of real numbers, a similar concept exists, called an orthogonal matrix.

An orthogonal matrix $A$ is a square matrix such that $A^T \cdot A = A \cdot A^T = I$, where $I$ is the identity matrix. This means that the columns (and rows) of the matrix are orthonormal, implying that the dot product of any two different columns (or rows) is zero, and the dot product of a column (or row) with itself is 1.

In the context of real numbers, orthogonal matrices play a similar role to unitary matrices in the context of complex numbers, in that they preserve lengths and angles (orthogonality) under matrix multiplication.
