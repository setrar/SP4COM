With this choice of $\\mathbf{h}^\\perp$, the signal $\\mathbf{y}_2[k]$ has a singular covariance matrix (due to the singularity of $P_{\\mathbf{h}}^\\perp$). This singularity may complicate some theoretical calculations, and affects the behavior of the LMS algorithm for the adaptation of $\\mathbf{f}$ (which, like $\\mathbf{y}_2[k]$, now has $m$ components, instead of $m−1$) in the long run. Nevertheless, the choice $\\mathbf{h}^\\perp = P_{\\mathbf{h}}^\\perp$ allows to treat all directions orthogonal to $\\mathbf{h}$ in a balanced fashion. One issue is that the component of $\\mathbf{\\tilde{f}}[k]$ in the direction of $\\mathbf{h}^H$ does not converge, it just remains constant: $\\mathbf{\\tilde{f}}[k]\\mathbf{h} = \\mathbf{\\tilde{f}}[0]\\mathbf{h}$. However, this is not a big problem, since the filter error $\\mathbf{\\tilde{f}}$ filters the signal $\\mathbf{x}[k]$, which by construction has no component in the direction of $\\mathbf{h}$. So the component of the error $\\mathbf{\\tilde{f}}$ in the direction of $\\mathbf{h}^H$ does not lead to any error in the output $\\mathbf{\\tilde{f}}\\mathbf{x}[k]$. Due to roundoff errors however, the component of the error $\\mathbf{\\tilde{f}}$ in the direction of $\\mathbf{h}^H$ may actually drift away instead of stay constant. This problem gets avoided in practice if $\\mathbf{h}$ varies in time and eventually occupies all directions.\n",
