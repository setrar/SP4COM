# Homework 3

This homework addresses the ultimate topic in the `SP4COM` course which is the design of beamformers at a multi-antenna transmitter (BS) while serving multiple users simultaneously. 

In class we have seen some such downlink considerations already, like space-time coding in absence of CSIT or the possibility of zero-forcing multi-user precoding which is the dual of zero-forcing multi-user reception in the uplink at the BS.

We shall see in class next week that the optimal linear precoding is a Minimum Mean-Squared Error (MMSE) precoding for a fictitious uplink (reception) dual of the actual downlink (transmission). We know that MMSE performs a compromise between zero-forcing and matched filtering. 

In the homework we pursue another form of implementing this compromise which is to zero-force to a subset of 
the interfered users, namely only the users most affected by the transmitted interference.

The homework is sufficiently self explanatory that you should be able to do it before next week's lectures.
