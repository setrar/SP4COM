    "Let's create a simplified example of the Viterbi algorithm using Julia. We'll implement a scenario where we decode the most likely weather sequence (hidden states) based on someone wearing different types of clothes (observed events). This example simplifies the concepts behind hidden Markov models (HMMs) and demonstrates how the Viterbi algorithm works.\n",

    "In this example, we consider two weather conditions (states): Sunny and Rainy. The observations are types of clothes: Coat, T-shirt, and Sweater. We'll set up transition probabilities between weather conditions, emission probabilities for wearing specific types of clothes given the weather, and initial state probabilities."
