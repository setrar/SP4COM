    "The difference between \"spatial\" and \"spatio-temporal\" receivers primarily concerns how they process and utilize data with respect to space and time:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Spatial Receivers:**\n",
    "   - **Focus on Space:** Spatial receivers are concerned solely with the spatial aspects of data. They focus on the arrangement, distribution, and relation of objects within a space.\n",
    "   - **Applications:** These receivers are used in systems where the main interest is the position or the spatial relation among objects, such as GPS systems, mapping technologies, or spatial data analysis in geography.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Spatio-Temporal Receivers:**\n",
    "   - **Focus on Space and Time:** Spatio-temporal receivers handle data that involves both spatial and temporal (time-related) dimensions. They consider not only where objects are but also how they change or move over time.\n",
    "   - **Applications:** These receivers are critical in scenarios where understanding the dynamic changes of spatial data over time is important. This includes tracking systems in transportation (e.g., tracking the movement of vehicles), environmental monitoring (e.g., observing changes in weather patterns or land use over time), and even in various scientific research areas that analyze spatial dynamics like wildlife tracking or epidemic spreading.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, the primary difference lies in the dimension of time — spatial receivers do not incorporate time into their analysis, while spatio-temporal receivers do, making the latter capable of understanding and predicting dynamics in a way that spatial-only systems cannot."
